# Character Creation System - Development Notes

## Project Overview
React TypeScript application for creating character sprites with layered assets. The system supports both static sprite assets and dynamic layer uploads with drag-and-drop positioning.

## Architecture

### Core Types (`src/types/sprite.ts`)
- **Static Sprite System**: Original system for pre-loaded sprite sheets with grid-based color variations
- **Upload System**: New dynamic system for user-uploaded individual layer images
- **LayerPosition**: Positioning system with x, y coordinates and z-index for layer ordering
- **UploadedLayer**: Complete layer definition with image data, dimensions, position, and properties
- **DragState**: State management for drag-and-drop interactions

### Component Structure

#### Upload-Based System (New)
- **UploadPanel**: Handles file uploads with drag-and-drop support
  - Base layer upload (required first)
  - Additional layer uploads with automatic positioning suggestions
  - File validation and error handling
- **DraggableCanvas**: Interactive canvas with drag-and-drop layer positioning
  - Visual layer rendering with proper z-ordering
  - Mouse-based drag interactions
  - Layer selection and highlighting
- **LayerManagement**: Layer property controls
  - Opacity and visibility controls
  - Layer reordering (z-index management)
  - Layer deletion and renaming
- **UploadExportPanel**: Export functionality for uploaded layers
  - PNG export (flattened image)
  - JSON export (layer data without images)
  - Godot .tres export (game engine format)

#### Static Sprite System (Original)
- **SpriteCanvas**: Renders pre-loaded sprite assets
- **LayerSelector**: Asset selection interface
- **ExportPanel**: Export functionality for static sprites

### Utilities

#### Upload System (`src/utils/uploadUtils.ts`)
- **File Processing**: Image loading, dimension extraction, base64 conversion
- **Layer Creation**: Automated layer object creation with positioning
- **Position Calculation**: Smart positioning to avoid overlaps
- **Export Functions**: JSON and Godot format exports

#### Static System (`src/utils/`)
- **assetLoader.ts**: Pre-loaded asset management
- **spriteGridLoader.ts**: Sprite sheet grid extraction
- **exportUtils.ts**: Static sprite export functionality

## Key Features

### Upload System
1. **Dynamic Layer Creation**: Users upload individual image files as layers
2. **Smart Positioning**: Automatic positioning suggestions to avoid overlaps
3. **Drag-and-Drop**: Interactive layer positioning with visual feedback
4. **Layer Management**: Full control over opacity, visibility, z-order
5. **Multiple Export Formats**: PNG, JSON, and Godot .tres formats

### Static System
1. **Sprite Sheet Support**: Grid-based sprite sheets with color variations
2. **Asset Mapping**: Comprehensive sprite analysis and categorization
3. **Color Variations**: Multiple color options per sprite asset

## Development Patterns

### Component Naming
- Use CamelCase: `UploadPanel`, `DraggableCanvas`, `LayerManagement`
- Descriptive names that indicate functionality

### State Management
- React hooks with TypeScript types
- Callback-based event handling
- Immutable state updates

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS with tailwind-variants for component variations
- Consistent spacing and color schemes
- Responsive design patterns

### File Organization
- Components in `/src/components/`
- Types in `/src/types/`
- Utilities in `/src/utils/`
- Documentation in `/docs/`

## Technical Implementation

### Drag and Drop System
- Mouse event handling for layer positioning
- Global event listeners during drag operations
- Real-time position updates with bounds checking
- Visual feedback during drag operations

### File Upload Processing
- FileReader API for image loading
- Canvas API for dimension extraction
- Base64 encoding for image storage
- Error handling for invalid files

### Layer Positioning Algorithm
- Grid-based overlap detection
- Automatic positioning suggestions
- Manual drag-and-drop override capability
- Z-index management for layer ordering

### Export System
- Canvas API for PNG generation
- JSON serialization for layer data
- Godot resource format generation
- Blob API for file downloads

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Layer Groups**: Organize related layers together
2. **Blend Modes**: Different layer blending options
3. **Animation Support**: Frame-based animation system
4. **Undo/Redo**: Action history management
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Productivity improvements
6. **Layer Templates**: Predefined layer arrangements
7. **Batch Operations**: Multiple layer operations
8. **Cloud Storage**: Save/load projects online

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Image Compression**: Reduce memory usage
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large layer lists
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load layers on demand
4. **Caching**: Improve repeated operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Utility function tests
- State management tests
- File processing tests

### Integration Tests
- Upload workflow tests
- Drag-and-drop interaction tests
- Export functionality tests
- Error handling tests

### User Experience Tests
- Accessibility compliance
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Deployment Considerations

### Build Optimization
- Code splitting for large applications
- Asset optimization and compression
- Bundle size monitoring
- Performance profiling

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with File API support
- Canvas API compatibility
- Drag and drop API support
- Local storage capabilities
